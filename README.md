# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
In this project, I created a Python class called Data that extracts data from a CSV file. 
I then used the NUMPY Python library to perform computations on numeric data, selected and organized by variable name, 
and used the MATPLOTLIB python library to create a variety of different visualizations. 
Finally, I used the tools I implemented to analyze real world datasets.
